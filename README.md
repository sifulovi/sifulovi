**Hi there!**  
I’m **Siful Islam Ove,** a **Full Stack Engineer** based in Dhaka, Bangladesh 🇧🇩. My hometown is Chadpur, Bangladesh. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science 🎓. During my final semester, I secured an internship at a small software firm in 2017. I’ve always had an interest in almost everything, except for my education 😅. I wasn’t particularly interested in computer programming at that time. Before the internship, I only knew about basic programming like `if-else` and `switch` case. I didn’t even know how to write a loop back then! 😂

During my internship, I had the opportunity to learn Java ☕. I started creating small applications using Groovy on Grails, and for some reason, I felt excited about building applications. That excitement has stayed with me ever since 🚀.

I’m passionate about learning new technologies 💡. I built a CRUD application using Grails, Spring, Angular, .NET, and ReactJS out of curiosity during my first full time job 👨‍💻. Then, one of my seniors suggested that I should focus on learning at least one technology deeply 🧠. Since then, I’ve specialized in Java-based technologies for application development. I have gained significant experience in building enterprise applications, such as ERP systems, education management systems 📊, and e-commerce platforms 🛒. Currently, I’m leading a team 👨‍💻👩‍💻 to develop enterprise-level applications 🏢.
